# PWMP Client library
This crate contains the library used by nodes to connect to and communicate with the PWMP server.

# Example usage
Check [examples](examples/).

The library exports the [pwmp-types](../pwmp-types/) crate, so you don't need to include it separately in your `Cargo.toml`.

Further documentation can be generated using `cargo doc`.
